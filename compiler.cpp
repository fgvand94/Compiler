//I'm just going to build something that will translate only simple numericle operations
//to assembly as a start. I'm going to just only use int values in my code to
//start and make that work. basically store a value in a register, maping variable
//name to register store anothervalue. add those values in a third variable so add the registers. and then
//print to the screen. 

#include <string>
